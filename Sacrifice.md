There will never be a point in your ti — in your life — where it’s the right time to do a great thing. If you’re waiting for that perfect perfect moment, that perfect timing, it’s not going to happen. You know what you have to do? You have to create the perfect time, and the perfect opportunity, and the perfect situation.
生命裡永遠不會有一個讓你去做一件大事的完美時機，如果你還在等待一個完美的時機，這是不可能發生的。你知道自己要做什麼嗎？
你必須自己建立一個完美的時機，完美的機遇，和完美的情勢。

So a lot of people become comfortable. They stop growing, they stop wanting anything, they become satisfied.
所以大多數的人逐漸變得安逸。他們不再成長，不再渴望任何東西，他們變得很容易滿足。

People getting ready to go to jobs that they don’t like, jobs that are making them sick. You see when you are not pursuing your goal, you are literally committing spiritual suicide. When you have some goal out here that you are stretching for and reaching for that takes you out of your comfort zone, you’ll find out some talents and abilities you have that you didn’t know you have.
大多數人都做他們不想做的工作，工作讓他們生病。如果你不追求你的目標，你就是一個字面上的心靈罪犯。當你有一些可以延展和靠近的目標，會讓你脫離舒適圈，你最終會找到天份和你從來不知道的你原先就有的能力。

When the messenger of misery visits you, what are you going to do? What will keep you in the game.
當你遇到不幸的消息，你會怎麼辦？什麼可以讓你繼續在這場遊戲？

There are things that you think you’ll never need to know. That you may only need to know one time in your life, but that could save your life because you had that knowledge.
這裡有些事是你永遠不知道的。你只要知道生命只有一次，這能拯救你的生命，因為你有這些知識。

Unless you attempt to do something beyond that, which you’ve already mastered, you will never grow. What is it that you looked at, at some point in time and you decided that you couldn’t do it, that you talk yourself out of it.
除非你試著做一些超越你已經熟練的事，不然你永遠不會成長。？？？

You’re waiting on your next door neighbor to make it happen for you, it may not happen. If you’re waiting on your mother, or your father, they may be so ancient in their thinking, that they don’t understand this opportunity that you have. And if you’re waiting on them it may never get done.
你還在等未來會有事情發生，不可能會發生。如果你還在等你媽媽，或你爸爸，他們也許在思考上跟你很相似，但他們還是不清楚你有什麼機會。如果你還在等他們，那永遠不會發生。

You don’t beg average people to be phenomenal. You don’t beg good people to be phenomenal. You just are phenomenal, and you will attract phenomenal.
你不能奢望一般人變得非凡的人，你也不能奢望好人變得非凡的人。你自己就是非凡的人，然後你會希望那些非凡的人。

What reason can you remember, that you can call on, that you can reach on, that can make you get back up. Find that reason.
是怎樣的初衷能喚起你，讓你呼喊，讓你觸摸，支撐你，找到這個初衷。

If you’re not where you are. If you’re not where you want to be. If you don’t have what you want, want to have. If you’re not where you think you should be at this particular place. It has nothing to do with the system, but it has everything to do with the fact that you’re not making the sacrifice.
如果你不知道你是誰。如果你不知道你想成為怎樣的人。如果你沒有自己想要的東西。如果你沒有想要在特定的地方。別去怪罪任何人，因為你沒有做一些犧牲去做任何事。

I want you to make that dream become a reality, because if you don’t, you will be working for somebody else to make their dreams become a reality.
我要你把夢成真，因為如果你不這樣做，你就會幫別人把夢成真。

And everybody is against you, or don’t believe in you no more. And let me tell you something, that’s a lonely feeling. That’s a lonely feeling. Particularly people that you are doing it for.
每個人都反對你，或者不再相信你。我告訴你，這就是孤獨的感覺，只會有特定的人能感受到。

Most people take their greatness, take their ideas to the graveyard with them.

Listen to me, if it was easy, everybody would do it. There are people right now who are working who don’t want to work. There are people who hate their jobs, but they keep getting up to do it.

The wealthiest place on the planet, is the graveyard. Because in the graveyard we will find inventions that we never ever were exposed to. Ideas, dreams, that never became reality. Hopes and aspirations that were never acted upon.

The question is what are you going to do with your time. What drives you. Greatness is a lot of small things done well. Day, after day. Workout after workout. Obedience after obedience. Day after day.

When things don’t work out for you. When things happen that you could not anticipate. What are the reasons that you can think of that can keep you strong.

You will never ever be successful, until you turn your pain into greatness, until you allow your pain to push you from where you are to push you to where you need to be. Stop running from your pain and embrace your pain. Your pain is going to be a part of your prize, a part of your product. I challenge you to push yourself.

See it’s easy to be on the bottom, it doesn’t take any effort to be a loser. It doesn’t take any motivation and any drive in order to stay down there on a low level. But it calls on everything in you. You have to harness your will to say I’m going to challenge myself.

I mean that what you did last week don’t count. Today today is the only important day. There are eighty-six thousand, four hundred seconds in a day and how you use those are critical. You got eighty-six thousand, four hundred today and what you do today is going to cement who you are. Nobody gonna talk about what you did last week.

Yet the biggest enemy that you have to deal with is yourself. There’s an old African proverb that says “If there’s no enemy within, the enemy outside can do us no harm.”

You have this opportunity of a lifetime. It means absolutely nothing if you don’t take advantage of it in the lifetime of this opportunity.

I got a saying that when life knocks you down, try to land on your back, because if you can look up, you can get up. If you want a thing bad enough to go out and fight for it, to work day and night for it, to give up your time and your peace and your sleep for it. If all that you dream and scheme is about it. And life seems useless and worthless without it.

See it’s time now. If you want to make this your decade, you’ve to start saying yes to your life. You’ve got to start saying yes to your dreams. Yes to your unfolding future. Yes to your potential. As opposed to saying no.

When you die, die on E. Leave no dream left behind guys. Leave no opportunity left behind. When you leave this earth, accomplish every single thing you can accomplish.

Listen to me, you’re going to be here one day, but you’ll never get here if you give up, if you give in, if you quit. And finally guys, you gotta wanna succeed, as bad, as you wanna, breath.
