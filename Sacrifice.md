There will never be a point in your ti — in your life — where it’s the right time to do a great thing. If you’re waiting for that perfect perfect moment, that perfect timing, it’s not going to happen. You know what you have to do? You have to create the perfect time, and the perfect opportunity, and the perfect situation.

> 人生中沒有「作大事」的完美時機。

> 如果你在等待那完美時機自己出現，那是永遠不會發生的。

> 你知道該怎麼辦嗎？

> 你必須自己去創造一個完美的時機，完美的機遇，和完美的局勢

So a lot of people become comfortable. They stop growing, they stop wanting anything, they become satisfied.
> 大多數的人逐漸變得安逸。他們不再成長，不再渴望任何東西，他們滿足於現況。

People getting ready to go to jobs that they don’t like, jobs that are making them sick. You see when you are not pursuing your goal, you are literally committing spiritual suicide. When you have some goal out here that you are stretching for and reaching for that takes you out of your comfort zone, you’ll find out some talents and abilities you have that you didn’t know you have.

> 許多人作著他們不滿意的工作 -- 讓他們覺得反胃的工作。

> 聽著：當你不努力追求你的人生目標，那你就是在心靈與精神上自殘。

> 當你有想努力伸出手去拼命掙取、強制你走出舒適圈的人生目標時，你會發現你從來不知道你有的天賦與能力。

When the messenger of misery visits you, what are you going to do? What will keep you in the game.
> 當你遇到挫敗時，你會怎麼作？什麼樣的信念可以支持你屢敗屢戰？

There are things that you think you’ll never need to know. That you may only need to know one time in your life, but that could save your life because you had that knowledge.
> 有些事你覺得你沒必要去學習。但你一生中可能就正好有那麼一次需要那些知識，而那些知識將救你一命。

Unless you attempt to do something beyond that, which you’ve already mastered, you will never grow. What is it that you looked at, at some point in time and you decided that you couldn’t do it, that you talk yourself out of it.
> 除非你嘗試去作你已駕輕就熟以外的事，你將永遠不會成長。
> 想想有哪些事，是你曾經想過去嘗試，但覺得自己辦不到，最後說服你自己放棄。

You’re waiting on your next door neighbor to make it happen for you, it may not happen. If you’re waiting on your mother, or your father, they may be so ancient in their thinking, that they don’t understand this opportunity that you have. And if you’re waiting on them it may never get done.
> 你想等別人帶著你作大事，那大概不會成真。
> 你想等你的父母帶著你作大事？他們的思想可能是如此古老，他們根本不了解你在這時代所擁有的機會。
> 如果你打算依賴父母領導你作大事，那大概永遠辦不成。

You don’t beg average people to be phenomenal. You don’t beg good people to be phenomenal. You just are phenomenal, and you will attract phenomenal.
> 你無法要求普通人搖身一變變成作大事的人。
> 你無法要求有德人搖身一變變成作大事的人。
> 作大事的人就是有作大事的人的自覺，而作大事的人將會吸引作大事的人。

What reason can you remember, that you can call on, that you can reach on, that can make you get back up. Find that reason.
> 是什麼樣的信念與理由，可以讓你依恃，可以讓你想伸手拼命掙取，可以讓你重新站起來？
> 去找到那樣的信念與理由！

If you’re not where you are. If you’re not where you want to be. If you don’t have what you want, want to have. If you’re not where you think you should be at this particular place. It has nothing to do with the system, but it has everything to do with the fact that you’re not making the sacrifice.
> 如果你不知道你在人生道路上的位置。
如果你不知道你在人生道路上該往哪走。
如果你還沒有取得你想要的東西。
如果你還沒有爬上你想要的位置。
別怨天尤人，這一切都只是因為你還沒有付出相對的代價與犧性。

I want you to make that dream become a reality, because if you don’t, you will be working for somebody else to make their dreams become a reality.
> 我要你去實現你的夢想。
因為如果你不去作，那你最後就會去為別人工作，去實現別人的夢想。

And everybody is against you, or don’t believe in you no more. And let me tell you something, that’s a lonely feeling. That’s a lonely feeling. Particularly people that you are doing it for.
> 當每個人都反對你，每個人都不看好你時，我知道，那是種非常孤獨的感覺，真的非常孤獨的感覺。
尤其是當不看好你的人就正是你想努力為他們打拼的人。

Most people take their greatness, take their ideas to the graveyard with them.
> 大多數人帶著他們的天賦與理想步入墳墓。

Listen to me, if it was easy, everybody would do it. There are people right now who are working who don’t want to work. There are people who hate their jobs, but they keep getting up to do it.
> 聽好，如果這很簡單，那其他人早就在作了。此時此刻，有人心不甘情不願地工作、作著他們厭惡的工作，但他們最後還是乖乖照作。

The wealthiest place on the planet, is the graveyard. Because in the graveyard we will find inventions that we never ever were exposed to. Ideas, dreams, that never became reality. Hopes and aspirations that were never acted upon.
> 這星球上最富有的地方，就是墳場。因為在墳場裡，埋著我們從來沒看過的、沒有成真的發明、理想、夢想；沒有被實踐的希望與靈感。

The question is what are you going to do with your time. What drives you. Greatness is a lot of small things done well. Day, after day. Workout after workout. Obedience after obedience. Day after day.
> 最重要的問題就是: 「你如何運用你的時間？驅使你前進的原動力是什麼？」「偉大的成就」就是把許多微不足道的小事作好所累積起來的。一天又一天。一次又一次。忠實地遵循這個原則。一天又一天，把無數微不足道的小事，作好。

When things don’t work out for you. When things happen that you could not anticipate. What are the reasons that you can think of that can keep you strong.
> 當事情進展不如預期，當意外狀況發生時，你必須想想: 有什麼樣的理由、人事物，能給你堅強的意志，支持你繼續走下去？

You will never ever be successful, until you turn your pain into greatness, until you allow your pain to push you from where you are to push you to where you need to be. Stop running from your pain and embrace your pain. Your pain is going to be a part of your prize, a part of your product. I challenge you to push yourself.
> 除非你能把痛苦轉化成你的偉大志向，除非你讓「困境」驅使你從「現況」邁向理想，不然，你永遠也無法成功。正面面對困境，不要再逃避。「克服困境中痛苦」將變成你的成就，將會是你給自己最好的獎品。我在此挑戰你: 超越你的極限！

See it’s easy to be on the bottom, it doesn’t take any effort to be a loser. It doesn’t take any motivation and any drive in order to stay down there on a low level. But it calls on everything in you. You have to harness your will to say I’m going to challenge myself.
> 你看，要留在底層是很簡單的；不費吹灰之力，不需要任何動力，不需要任何決心，就能變成魯蛇。但是！若要挑戰自己、超越自己極限，你必須使出洪荒之力，凝聚你所有的意志力，向你自己下戰書: 我要超越我自己！

I mean that what you did last week don’t count. Today today is the only important day. There are eighty-six thousand, four hundred seconds in a day and how you use those are critical. You got eighty-six thousand, four hundred today and what you do today is going to cement who you are. Nobody gonna talk about what you did last week.
> 告訴你: 你上週作過的努力，已經是過去了。「今天」，才是最重要的。一天有八萬六千四百秒，你如何運用這八萬六千四百秒才是最關鍵的。你「今天」作的事才會定義你是誰；沒有人會去關心你上週有多努力。

Yet the biggest enemy that you have to deal with is yourself. There’s an old African proverb that says “If there’s no enemy within, the enemy outside can do us no harm.”
> 你最大的敵人，是你自己。有句非洲俗話說: 「如果沒有內賊，那外敵將無法傷我分毫」

You have this opportunity of a lifetime. It means absolutely nothing if you don’t take advantage of it in the lifetime of this opportunity.
> 這是你人生中的大好機會。但如果你在這大好機會消逝前不好好把握的話，那就什麼也不是。

I got a saying that when life knocks you down, try to land on your back, because if you can look up, you can get up. If you want a thing bad enough to go out and fight for it, to work day and night for it, to give up your time and your peace and your sleep for it. If all that you dream and scheme is about it. And life seems useless and worthless without it.
> 如果你有渴望、追求的事物、願意為它奮戰的事物、為它日夜不停努力的事物、為它不惜放棄睡眠與安逸的生活的事物、你所有夢想與計畫寄託於上的的事物、少了它生命就索然無味的事物，那麼: 當命運把你打倒在地上時，用你的背部去著地；因為，如果你仍能往上看，那你就能爬起來。

See it’s time now. If you want to make this your decade, you’ve to start saying yes to your life. You’ve got to start saying yes to your dreams. Yes to your unfolding future. Yes to your potential. As opposed to saying no.
> 就是現在！如果你要造就你的時代，你必須正面面對你的人生，你必須正面面對你的夢想，你必須正面面對未來，你必須正面面對你的潛力與可能性。而不是虛與委蛇、欺騙自己。

When you die, die on E. Leave no dream left behind guys. Leave no opportunity left behind. When you leave this earth, accomplish every single thing you can accomplish.
> 當你停下腳步時，確認你已經使盡渾身解數。不要留下任何未完成的夢想。不要留下任何沒抓住的機會。當你離開人事時，完成所有你可以完成的事。註: 此處 E 應該是指車子油箱「空(Empty)」的狀態, 相對於「滿(Full)」


Listen to me, you’re going to be here one day, but you’ll never get here if you give up, if you give in, if you quit. And finally guys, you gotta wanna succeed, as bad, as you wanna, breath.
> 聽好！你有一天會成功，但前提是你不能放棄、不能投降、不能離場。你對於成功的渴望，必須要像你對於呼吸空氣的渴望一樣，沒有它，你就活不下去。
